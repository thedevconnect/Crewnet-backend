Mujhe ek complete Angular application banana hai jo neeche diye gaye backend APIs ke saath integrate ho. Backend already ready hai.

BACKEND BASE URL: http://localhost:3000/api

AUTHENTICATION:
- JWT token required for protected routes
- Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
- Token store karo localStorage me after login

APIS TO INTEGRATE:

1. AUTH APIs:
   - POST /api/auth/register - {name, email, password}
   - POST /api/auth/login - {email, password} - returns {success, token, user}
   - GET /api/auth/users?page=1&limit=100&search= - returns users list with pagination

2. EMPLOYEE APIs:
   - GET /api/employees?page=1&limit=10&sortBy=name&sortOrder=ASC - returns employees with pagination
   - GET /api/employees/:id - get single employee
   - POST /api/employees - create employee {name, email, phone, department, status, joiningDate}
   - PUT /api/employees/:id - update employee
   - DELETE /api/employees/:id - delete employee

3. ATTENDANCE APIs (All require JWT):
   - POST /api/attendance/swipe-in - swipe in for today
   - POST /api/attendance/swipe-out - swipe out for today
   - GET /api/attendance/today-status - returns {canSwipeIn, canSwipeOut, attendance}

REQUIREMENTS:

1. SERVICES:
   - AuthService: register(), login(), getUsers(), logout(), isAuthenticated(), getToken()
   - EmployeeService: getEmployees(), getEmployee(), createEmployee(), updateEmployee(), deleteEmployee()
   - AttendanceService: swipeIn(), swipeOut(), getTodayStatus()

2. COMPONENTS:
   - LoginComponent: Login form with email/password
   - RegisterComponent: Registration form
   - EmployeeListComponent: Table with pagination, search, sort
   - EmployeeFormComponent: Create/Edit employee (reusable)
   - EmployeeDetailComponent: View employee details
   - AttendanceDashboardComponent: Swipe in/out buttons with status
   - DashboardComponent: Main dashboard with stats
   - HeaderComponent: Navigation with user info and logout

3. FEATURES:
   - JWT authentication with token storage
   - AuthGuard for protected routes
   - HTTP Interceptor to add Authorization header automatically
   - Form validation (Angular reactive forms)
   - Loading spinners during API calls
   - Toast notifications for success/error
   - Responsive design (Angular Material or Bootstrap)
   - Error handling (401 redirect to login, show user-friendly errors)
   - Pagination for employee list
   - Search and sort functionality
   - Confirmation dialogs for delete

4. ROUTING:
   / -> Login (if not auth) or Dashboard
   /login -> Login page
   /register -> Register page
   /dashboard -> Main dashboard (protected)
   /employees -> Employee list (protected)
   /employees/new -> Add employee (protected)
   /employees/:id -> Employee details (protected)
   /employees/:id/edit -> Edit employee (protected)
   /attendance -> Attendance dashboard (protected)

5. UI/UX:
   - Modern, clean design
   - Mobile responsive
   - Loading states
   - Error messages
   - Success notifications
   - Form validation with error messages
   - Date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD for backend, readable format for display)

6. TECHNICAL:
   - Angular 17+ with TypeScript
   - RxJS for observables
   - Angular Material or Bootstrap
   - Reactive Forms
   - HTTP Client
   - Router

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Setup Angular project with routing
2. Create services (Auth, Employee, Attendance)
3. Create HTTP Interceptor for JWT
4. Create AuthGuard
5. Create authentication components (Login, Register)
6. Create employee management components
7. Create attendance components
8. Create dashboard and layout
9. Add error handling and loading states
10. Test all functionality

Sab kuch production-ready code me banana hai with proper error handling, validation, and user experience.
